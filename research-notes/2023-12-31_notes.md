## Mechanics

### Menu Systems
* Menu that players can access at most times during gameplay
* Include several options such as inventory, settings, save and exit
* How to change controls to work with the menu?

### Save Game
* How to record the player's current progress?
* Overwriting data, please don't turn off the power...
* What information stays, what information is discarded?

### Player Score
* A scoreboard that updates as the player makes progress.
* The player's high score is saved. If beaten, the high score will update immediately.

### Basic Crafting
* Collecting items from drops or the environment
* Combining items to make a new item
* A network of different recipes

## Prompt Files

### Algorithmic Thinking
* prompt-engineering for a game development assistant that makes pseudocode.
    * to code most things: the ability to break down something you want to make into logical chunks. this is basically what pseudocode is. then, you can convert it to actual code, in the language you're working in.
    * figure out what learning and workflow strategies work for you.
* break down complex problems, then design solutions that meet the desired outcomes

## Classics (Breakdown)

### Pong
```
* initialize game
    * set up paddle and ball
    * set initial positions and velocities
* while game is running:
    * update paddle positions based on player input
    * update ball position based on velocity
    * (if) ball hits top or bottom wall:
        * reflect ball vertically
    * (if) ball hits the paddle:
        * reflect ball horizontally
    * draw paddles and ball on the screen
    * check for collisions and update game state
* end game
```

### Tic-Tac-Toe
```
* initialize game board
* set current player to "X"
* while game is not over:
    * display game board
    * get player move
    * place player's symbol on the board
    * (if) current player wins or board is full:
        * End game
    * (else) switch to the other player
* display result
```

### Snake
```
* initialize snake with a length of 1 and position
* place initial food randomly on the grid
* while game is running:
    * get user input for snake direction
    * move snake in the current direction
    * (if) snake collides with food:
        * increase snake length and place new food
    * (if) snake collides with itself or wall:
        * End game
* display result
```

## Survival Games

### Likes
* Problem solving and risk management

### Dislikes
* Grind for the sake of grind

### Unsure
* Hunger mechanics
    * A staple in many survival games
    * Can the player reliably produce and store food?
    * "Food has no additional value other than necessity [...] meaning players will just regulate and optimize it into the most efficient routine."

### Unsorted
* Don't Starve: 
    * Eat regularly and temperature gauge (Winter)
    * Players have the whole day to explore, but when the sun sets, it's essential for the player to have some sort of light source. Being in darkness will outright kill the player as they get attacked by something they can't see.
        * Sanity will decrease as your light source deminishes.
* Project Zomboid:
    * Players need to look after their needs (hunger, thirst, sleep), the player needs to avoid hordes of zombies that lurk in every building and every street.
        * Players are not immune to zombies. Players need to avoid bites and tend to their injuries.
